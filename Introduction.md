# Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Clustering-Methods-for-Single-cell-and-Spatial-Transcriptomics-Data
## Introduction
In recent years, single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics have emerged as focal points of research interest. In practice, a single scRNA-seq experiment captures gene expression data from tens of thousands of individual cells. However, dealing with such high-dimensional data poses challenges for subsequent analysis.
Consequently, the adoption of dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering methods has become an indispensable strategy in transcriptomic analysis for noise reduction and enhancing data visualization. Dimensionality reduction and clustering help eliminate noise and redundancy in the original data, and it aids in mitigating the impact of "dropout" events, thereby facilitating subsequent steps in data visualization and clustering. Furthermore, clustering plays a crucial role in uncovering cellular heterogeneity and exploring underlying biological mechanisms, holding significant biological implications. Based on the aforementioned necessity, numerous methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering have been developed, tailored to different transcriptomic datasets.
It is noteworthy that each algorithm has its own strengths and limitations, leading to distinct characteristics and performance features among different algorithms. Due to the typically elevated levels of noise in spatial transcriptomics data, many dimensionality reduction and clustering methods initially designed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data may not be directly applicable to the field of spatial transcriptomics. Consequently, researchers have recently begun developing specialized dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques tailored specifically to address the unique challenges posed by spatial transcriptomics.
This review aims to comprehensively examine the existing dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques applicable to both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets. It encompasses a comprehensive overview of dimensionality reduction and clustering methodologies for both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, along with insights into their respective contexts of applicability. Furthermore, it offers valuable recommendations to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable dimensionality reduction and clustering methodologies tailored to the unique demands of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Our review aims to serve as a practical resource, equipping researchers with the necessary knowledge and references to make informed choices when working with scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets, catering to their specific research requirements.
